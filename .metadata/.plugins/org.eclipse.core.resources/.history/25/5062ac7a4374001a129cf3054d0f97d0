//Multilevel Inheritance Example

//When there is a chain of inheritance, it is known as multilevel inheritance.
//As you can see in the example given below, BabyDog class inherits the Dog class 
//which again inherits the Animal class, so there is a multilevel inheritance.

//Parent Class
public class Animal1 {

	//Method
	void eat() {
		System.out.println("eating...");
	}
}
