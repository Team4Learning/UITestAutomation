//Example3: Overloading â€“ Sequence of data type of arguments

//Here method disp() is overloaded based on sequence of data type of parameters
// Both the methods have different sequence of data type in argument list. 
//First method is having argument list as (char, int) and second is having (int, char).
//Since the sequence is different, the method can be overloaded without any issues.
