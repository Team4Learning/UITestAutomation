//Example3: Overloading – Sequence of data type of arguments

//Here method disp() is overloaded based on sequence of data type of parameters
// Both the methods have different sequence of data type in argument list. 
//First method is having argument list as (char, int) and second is having (int, char).
//Since the sequence is different, the method can be overloaded without any issues.

public class DisplayOverloading2 {

	// Method with 2 parameters , Sequence char & int
	public void disp(char c, int num) {
		System.out.println('c', num); // Prints
	}

	// Method with 2 parameters , Sequence int and char
	public void disp(int num, char c) {
		System.out.println("I’m the second definition of method disp"); // Prints
	}
}
