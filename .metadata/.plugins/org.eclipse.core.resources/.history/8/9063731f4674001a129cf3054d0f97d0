//Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?
//
// 1) To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, 
//    multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
  
// 2) Example: Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes. The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes have the same method and you call it from child class object, there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.

public class A {
	

}
