//Single Inheritance: When a class inherits another class, it is known as a single inheritance. 

// Example: In the example given below, Dog class inherits the Animal class, 
//          so there is the single inheritance.
//

//Parent Class
public class Animal {
	
	//method
	void eat() {
		System.out.println("eating...");
	}

}
