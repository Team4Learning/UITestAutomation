//Method Overriding: If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, 
//                   it is known as method overriding in Java.
//Usage of Java Method Overriding:
// 
//  a)Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already 
//    provided by its superclass.
//  b)Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism

//Rules for Java Method Overriding :

//  a)The method must have the same name as in the parent class
//  b)The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
//  c)There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).


//Creating a parent class  
public class Dog {
	
	public void bark()
	   {
	      System.out.println("Dog is barking");
	   }
