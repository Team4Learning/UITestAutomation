//Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?

//
// 1) To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, 
//    multiple inheritance is not supported in java.

// 2) Example: Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes. 
//             The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes 
//             have the same method and you call it from child class object, 
//             there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.

// 3)Since compile-time errors are better than runtime errors, Java renders 
//   compile-time error if you inherit 2 classes. So whether you have same method 
//   or different, there will be compile time error.

public class A {
	void msg() {
		System.out.println("Hello");
	}

}
