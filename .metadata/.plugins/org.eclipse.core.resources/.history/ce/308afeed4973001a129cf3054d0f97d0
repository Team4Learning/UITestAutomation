Method Overloading 

1)Method overloading is used to increase the readability of the program.

2)Method overloading is performed within class.

3)In case of method overloading, parameter must be different.

4)Method overloading is the example of compile time polymorphism.

5)In java, method overloading can't be performed by changing return 
  type of the method only. Return type can be same or different in method overloading. 
  But you must have to change the parameter.
