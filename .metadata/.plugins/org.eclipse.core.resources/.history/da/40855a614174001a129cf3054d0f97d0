// Inheritance : Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all 
//               the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
//    1)Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a
//      parent-child relationship.
//
//    2)Advantage Of Inheritance:
//
//      a)For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
//  
//      b)For Code Reusability.
//
//    3)The syntax of Java Inheritance:
//      
//       class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name
//       {
//            methods and fields  
//    	 }  
//     The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class.
//     The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.
//
//  Example: Following example depicts the Inheritance:
//
//  Note: a) Programmer is the subclass and Employee is the superclass. The relationship between the
//           two classes is Programmer IS-A Employee. It means that Programmer is a type of Employee.
//           
//

public class Employee {

	float salary = 40000;

}
